# Introduction

Notes of MIT18.06--Linear Algebra.

- Video address: [MIT Linear Algebra](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bb411H7JN?p=1)

- Reference: [ast-interview/math](https://github.com/ast-interview/math)



For a better reading experience, maybe the reference repo is a better choice for Chinese, I made this repo for several reasons:

- English is the basic requirement for learning more excellent course.

- most English course I made notes in English.

- this practice my English writing and slow down the speed I watch the video so that I could have more time to understand the knowledge.

Due to the Github pages can't analyse LaTex formula, so I transform the `.md` files to `.pdf`.
